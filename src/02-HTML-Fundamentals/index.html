<h2> The Basic Language of the Web: HTML</h2>
<h3>What is HTML?</h3>
<p>
  HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a programming language).
</p>
<p>
  HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.
